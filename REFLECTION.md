- In this project, I am to showcase my basic knowledge og HTML syntax,
elements, and other components of HTML.

- my second commit focused more on divided the page into different group
this is very beneficial during styling.

- third commit, i showcased my knowgledge of some of the html guidline,
which includes how many time you can use certain elements in a webpage ,
to keep the page in nice look. example using the H1 element often is not
a good use, instead, you should limit your use of certain element.

- i added a link to my resume project, also an image and a svg graphics.

- I did some html validation, where i some errors in my img and svg 
elements and provided solutions for them.

- Finally, I added a portifolio to my resume, and made my nineth commit.
